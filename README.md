The Predator Alert Tool for Facebook is designed for survivors of sexual assault and rape. It allows you to share information about people in your social network who may be dangerous without having to reveal your identity.

Using Predator Alert Tool for Facebook, you can:

* **Talk about it.** Contribute your story with as much or as little detail as you feel comfortable sharing.
* **Decide who knows.** Control who gets to see your story and who doesn't. Display your identity only to the people you choose.
* **Get support.** Connect with friends who have had a bad experience with the same person you did.
* **Hear about it.** Find out about others' bad experiences with people you know.
